HOW IT WORKS

1. Logging In
2. Balance
3. Daily Dish
4. Hours
5. Budget
6. MyStats

Logging In
If you are using the app for the first time, you might see this welcome screen:

If you already have a ManageMyID account, enter your username and password into the two textboxes and click” Sign in.” Otherwise, click the link that says “Get one here”, which will redirect you to ManageMyID’s website in the browser. You can create an account there.

Balance

After logging in, the app will direct you to this view:

<balance_screenshot.png>

This view shows you the number of Meal Swipes you have left and the amount of DBA you have left. It also shows you the main view of the app, which has several tabs at the top. You can touch each tab to navigate to it, or you can simply swipe horizontally across the screen. 

*Note: If this is the first time that you’ve logged in, it might take awhile (30 - 60 seconds) for the app to connect to ManageMyID, so please be patient! After logging in, the app will save your transaction history and current balance to a database on your phone.

To update the information while keeping the app open (it will automatically refresh every time you close and open the app), click “Refresh.”

You can also log out of your ManageMyID account here. Clicking “Logout” will navigate you back to the welcome screen. 

Daily Dish

The Daily Dish view shows the Dartmouth Dining website. It opens the page that has a list of the different specials for different dining locations:

Hours

This view shows the hours of all dining locations. The ones that are open are shown first:

Budget

This view shows how much you have spent per day and per week by averaging your DBA use over the term so far. In addition, it offers suggestions for future spending, aka how much you should aim to spend per day and per week going forward. 

On the left, there is a thermometer that is a visual representation of how much DBA you’ve spent in the term so far.

MyStats

MyStats is a view that shows two charts that display user data. The first shows where the user spends his or her DBA:

The second chart shows up if you press “Per Week.” Instead of a pie chart of dining locations, it’s a bar chart that shows spending per week:

You can toggle between the two charts using the two buttons.

Caveat:
This app depends heavily on internet connection. Without internet, the app cannot connect to ManageMyID and stay updated. In the worst case scenario, if you run the app after just downloading the app, it will not be able to log you in or grab any data (if you’ve logged in in the past, your phone will have old transaction history data).
